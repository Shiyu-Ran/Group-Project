the “Twelve Days of Christmas”

 On the first day of Christmas My true love sent to me:
A partridge in a pear tree
On the second day of Christmas My true love sent to me:
Two turtle doves and
A partridge in a pear tree
On the third day of Christmas My true love sent to me: Three French hens
Two turtle doves and
A partridge in a pear tree
